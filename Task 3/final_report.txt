Final Report: Air Pollutant Data Analysis & Clustering for Unsupervised Machine Learning

---

Objective:
The objective of this task was to:
- Preprocess the air pollutant dataset (handling missing values, feature selection, standardization).
- Apply K-Means Clustering & Hierarchical Clustering to find patterns in air pollution data.
- Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction.
- Implement Anomaly Detection to identify unusual pollution levels.

1. Data Preprocessing

**Steps Taken:**
- Loaded the dataset and examined its structure.
- Handled missing values:
  - Used mean imputation for numerical pollutants.
  - Removed features with excessive missing data.
- Feature selection:
  - Retained relevant air pollutants (CO, NOx, SO2, PM2.5, etc.).
- Standardization:
  - Applied StandardScaler (mean = 0, variance = 1) to normalize the data for clustering.

2. K-Means Clustering

**Methodology:**
- Used Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k).
- Fit K-Means on standardized pollutant levels.
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots and heatmaps.

**Findings:**
- 3-4 clusters were optimal, representing different pollution levels:
  - Cluster 1: Low pollution
  - Cluster 2: Moderate pollution
  - Cluster 3: High pollution
  - (Sometimes Cluster 4): Extreme pollution in some locations.

3. Hierarchical Clustering

**Methodology:**
- Used Agglomerative Clustering with different linkage methods (ward, complete, average).
- Plotted dendrograms to visualize cluster merging.

**Findings:**
- Showed similar patterns as K-Means.
- Hierarchical clustering was slower but more interpretable than K-Means.

4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Methodology:**
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality while retaining maximum variance.
- Selected 2-3 principal components (explaining ~85% variance).

**Findings:**
- PCA allowed better visualization of clusters.
- The first two principal components captured most of the pollution trends.

---

5. Anomaly Detection

**Methodology:**
- Used Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF).
- Flagged outliers in pollution levels.

**Findings:**
- Anomalies were mostly sudden spikes in pollution, likely due to:
  - Industrial emissions.
  - Weather changes.
  - Sensor errors.

Conclusion:
K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering successfully grouped pollution patterns. PCA reduced data complexity while preserving key information. Anomaly Detection identified pollution spikes, useful for environmental monitoring.
