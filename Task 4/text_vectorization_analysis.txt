Data Preprocessing and TF-IDF Vectorization Analysis

---

Step 1: Load the Preprocessed Data
The script begins by loading a CSV file that contains the SMS messages that have already undergone preprocessing. The CSV file is read into a pandas DataFrame. This data likely includes columns with SMS messages, their labels (spam or ham), and tokenized (or lemmatized) words.

**Expected Output:**
Data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame named `data`. The structure of the DataFrame will have columns like `lemmatized_tokens` (tokens in list form) and possibly a label column indicating spam or ham.

---

Step 2: Convert String Representation of Lists into Actual Lists
The column `lemmatized_tokens` in the DataFrame contains strings that look like Python lists (e.g., "[ 'i', 'love', 'programming']"). These need to be converted back into actual lists of words for processing.

The function `ast.literal_eval()` is used to safely convert these string representations into real Python lists.

**Expected Output:**
The `lemmatized_tokens` column will now contain actual lists of words instead of string representations. For example:
- Before: "[ 'i', 'love', 'programming']"
- After: ['i', 'love', 'programming']

---

Step 3: Join Tokens into Full Messages
Each SMS message was previously split into individual words or tokens. To use these in the vectorization step, the tokens need to be reassembled into full strings. This is done by joining the tokens into one string, with spaces separating each word.

**Expected Output:**
A new column `lemmatized_message` is created, where the individual tokens are joined back into a complete message. For example:
- Before: ['i', 'love', 'programming']
- After: 'i love programming'

Step 4: Initialize the TF-IDF Vectorizer
The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer is used to convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models. The vectorizer assigns a weight to each word based on how important it is across all messages in the dataset. The parameter `max_features=5000` ensures that only the 5000 most important words are kept.

**Expected Output:**
The vectorizer is initialized but hasn't been applied yet. It will be used in the next step to transform the text data into a matrix.

---

Step 5: Fit and Transform the Data
In this step, the vectorizer learns from the `lemmatized_message` column and transforms each SMS message into a row of numerical values (a sparse matrix). Each word that appears in the top 5000 most important words across the entire corpus of messages will be assigned a unique index in the matrix. The values in the matrix represent the TF-IDF score for each word in each message.

**Expected Output:**
A sparse matrix of TF-IDF values is generated. The shape of this matrix will be (number_of_messages, 5000), meaning each message is represented by a vector of 5000 values corresponding to the most important words. For example, if there are 5573 messages and 5000 words, the matrix will be of shape (5573, 5000). This matrix is highly sparse, meaning that most of its entries are zeros (because each message will only contain a small fraction of the total vocabulary).

---

Step 6: Print the Shape of the TF-IDF Matrix
The script prints the shape of the resulting TF-IDF matrix. This shape indicates the number of messages (rows) and the number of features (columns, corresponding to the 5000 most important words).

**Expected Output:**
For a dataset with 5573 messages and 5000 features, the output would be:
TF-IDF matrix shape: (5573, 5000)

This tells you the size of the TF-IDF matrix, where:
- 5573 is the number of SMS messages,
- 5000 is the number of features (distinct words) used in the vectorization.

---

Step 7: View the Feature Names (Words)
The script prints the first 10 words in the vocabulary used by the TF-IDF vectorizer. These words are the most important terms from the corpus, according to the TF-IDF calculation, and represent the features in the matrix.

**Expected Output:**
The first 10 words could look like this:
Feature names: ['aah', 'ability', 'abiola', 'abnormal', 'abroad', 'absence', 'absolutely', 'academic', 'acc', 'accent']

These are the terms that the model considers as features in the dataset. Each message is transformed into a numerical vector based on the occurrence of these words.

---

Step 8: Save the Transformed Data (Optional)
The transformed data, which is now in the form of a dense numerical matrix, can be saved as a CSV file. This allows users to use these features for training machine learning models. The matrix is converted into a pandas DataFrame, and then it's saved to a CSV file on disk.

**Expected Output:**
A CSV file (`tfidf_features.csv`) will be saved with the transformed TF-IDF features. This file will have rows corresponding to SMS messages, and columns corresponding to the top 5000 words, with each cell representing the TF-IDF score of a word in a message.

---

Summary of Outputs:
- **Shape of TF-IDF Matrix:** A sparse matrix with shape (number_of_messages, 5000), indicating size and number of features.
- **Feature Names:** The top 5000 words considered important across all messages.
- **Saved CSV:** The transformed features will be saved as a CSV file with numerical representations of SMS messages based on TF-IDF values.

These outputs represent the transformation of raw text data into a form that machine learning models can use for classification tasks like spam detection.
