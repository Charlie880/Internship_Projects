Summary of Observations

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    Data Cleaning:

    Whitespace in categorical values was trimmed to ensure consistency.
    No rows were dropped for duplicates as no exact duplicates were identified across all columns.
    Missing values were identified in numerical columns like mileage, engine, and max_power. These were filled using the median values to avoid skewing the data.

Categorical Features:

    Key categorical features (seller_type, owner, and transmission) were identified for analysis.
    These features were encoded as necessary for numerical analysis.

2. Data Visualization
    Numerical Features:

    mileage (km/ltr/kg): Higher mileage generally corresponds to lower selling prices, indicating that older or more fuel-efficient cars may be priced lower.

    engine (cc): Cars with larger engines (higher displacement) tend to have higher selling prices.
    
    max_power (bhp): A strong positive relationship is observed between maximum power and selling price. High-performance cars are priced significantly higher.

    Categorical Features:

    seller_type: Dealer cars tend to have higher average selling prices compared to individual sellers, likely due to better maintenance and warranties.
    owner: First-owner cars fetch significantly higher selling prices compared to cars with multiple owners.
    transmission: Automatic transmission cars have higher selling prices than manual ones, reflecting their market preference and added convenience.

    Pairplot Analysis:
    The scatterplots confirmed the relationships between numerical features and the target variable (selling_price), highlighting trends and outliers.
    Key Insights and Patterns

    Mileage vs. Price:
    Cars with higher mileage tend to have lower prices, possibly because mileage is an indicator of age and usage.

    Engine and Power vs. Price:
    Engine capacity and maximum power are positively correlated with selling price. Premium cars with powerful engines and high performance command higher prices.

    Transmission Impact:
    Automatic cars are priced higher than manual cars, reflecting a market trend where automatics are viewed as premium offerings.

    Owner and Selling Price:
    The number of previous owners significantly affects the price, with first-owner cars commanding the highest value.

    Seller Type:
    Dealers list cars at higher prices than individuals, likely reflecting better-maintained cars with additional assurances.
