1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    Steps Taken:
        Removed Duplicates: Exact duplicate rows were eliminated to ensure data integrity and avoid bias in the analysis.
        Whitespace Trimming: Whitespaces from string columns were trimmed to maintain consistency in data formatting.
        Missing Values Handling: Rows with critical missing data were dropped to ensure the quality of the dataset.
        Feature Retention: Categorical features such as seller_type, owner, and transmission, along with numerical features like engine, mileage, and max_power, were retained for further analysis.
2. Data Visualization
    Key Insights:
        Transmission Type: The majority of cars in the dataset are manual transmission vehicles.
        Ownership Trends: Most cars are owned by first owners and sold by individuals rather than dealerships.
        Price Correlations:
        Selling price shows a positive correlation with engine size, mileage, and maximum power.
        Categorical features such as seller type, owner, and transmission type significantly influence the selling price.
3. Machine Learning Feasibility
    Problem Type:
        Regression Problem: The target variable, selling_price, is continuous and numeric, making it suitable for regression analysis.
        Justification: The analysis indicates that car prices vary based on key numerical and categorical features.
    
    Learning Type:
        Supervised Learning: The dataset contains labeled data with known selling prices, allowing for supervised learning techniques.
        Justification: The relationships between features and selling price can be effectively modeled using supervised learning algorithms.
4. Recommended Approach
    To predict car prices accurately, it is recommended to utilize supervised regression algorithms such as:
    Linear Regression
    Random Forest
    Gradient Boosting

    Focus on Feature Engineering:
    Enhancing model accuracy through feature engineering will be crucial. This may involve creating interaction terms, normalizing data, or transforming features to better capture the relationships in the dataset.
